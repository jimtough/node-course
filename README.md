The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition) - my workspace

## Development notes
The course instructor recommended using Visual Studio Code as the IDE. I did so when I took the course.

## Initialization notes
You will need to run the command 'npm install' after cloning this Git repo. The npm utililty will download and install all the third-party modules these tutorial projects depend on.
